# Shared-Bike-Demand-Forecasting-Using-Machine-Learning

This project aims to predict daily bike demand using machine learning techniques, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. By analyzing patterns in demand based on weather, seasonal trends, and time-based variables, this model provides insights to optimize bike availability.

Project Overview

The project demonstrates a complete data science workflow:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key demand drivers and visualize relationships.
Data Preprocessing with feature encoding and feature engineering to improve model performance.
Predictive Modeling using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms.
Hyperparameter Tuning to optimize model performance.
Feature Importance Analysis to identify influential factors affecting demand.
Evaluation Summary and Reporting to compare model performance and select the best approach.

Project Structure

Data Loading and EDA: Load the data, check for missing values, and explore relationships between features.
Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data with feature engineering and train-test split.
Model Training and Evaluation:
Train models using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Evaluate each model based on R², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV to fine-tune model parameters for Random Forest and XGBoost.
Feature Importance Analysis: Visualize important features identified by the best-performing model.
Evaluation Summary: Compare models to select the best approach for demand prediction.

Results
The XGBoost model performed best, achieving a high R² score and lower error metrics after hyperparameter tuning.
Feature importance analysis identified weather, temperature, and season as top demand drivers.
Future Enhancements
Adding more advanced feature engineering to capture complex seasonal and trend patterns.
Incorporating explainability techniques like SHAP or LIME for model interpretability.
